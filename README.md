## Description
This project features an intrusion detection system implemented with an arduino mini. It will notify you if an obstacle was found.
This project is an intrusion detection system that utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to monitor for obstacles in a designated area. 
The system is designed to provide both visual and email notifications when an obstacle is detected.

## Features
+ Utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
+ Red LED blinks when no obstacle is detected
+ Blue LED blinks when an obstacle is detected
+ Sends an email notification when an obstacle is detected

## Hardware Components
+ HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
+ Red LED
+ Blue LED
+ Resistors
+ Breadboard
+ Jumper wires
+ Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino mini (in my case), ESP8266, or Raspberry Pi)
 
 ## Libraries
 + HCSR04
 + WiFiNINA
 + EMailSender
 + string
